# User-Friendly-Jukebox
A jukebox aimed at increasing the accessibility of complicated sound systems by simplifying the steps needed to play music.

This jukebox functions by splitting all music into seperate playlists. A user can then press a single button to play their desired playlist. When a button is pressed, the corresponding playlist begins to play and an LED indicator light turns ON to indicate which playlist is being played.

The User-Friendly-Jukebox is being developed while working towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals 3: Good Health & Well-being and 12: Responsible Consumption and Production.
